  "answer": "📘 Book Answer: Kinetic energy is a form of energy that a body possesses due to its motion. To find out how much kinetic energy a moving body possesses, an opposite force can be applied to stop its motion, and the work done by the force will equal the kinetic energy of the body.\n\n🧠 Teacher Explanation: Think of a ball rolling down a hill. The ball has kinetic energy because it's in motion. If we were to stop the ball, we would need to do work against its motion, which would equal the ball's kinetic energy.\n\n✅ Final Answer: Kinetic energy is the energy a body possesses due to its motion. To find its kinetic energy, apply an opposite force to stop the body and calculate the work done.",

      "text": "In energetics we study the energy changes that take place during a\nchemical reaction. These changes are caused by the making and breaking of\nbonds during a reaction. In most of the reactions the weak bonds of reactants\nbreak while in products new strong bonds are formed. Since energy is needed to\nbreak a bond while energy is evolved when a bond is formed, such reactions take\nplace always with the evolution of heat. If a reaction is accompanied with the\nevolution of heat it is called an exothermic reaction and if heat is absorbed\nduring a reaction it is called an endothermic reaction.\n\nIn energetics we not only encounter heat which comes out of a chemical\nreaction but also another quantity which is called enthalpy>>\n\nEnthalpy (H) or heat content, is defined the total Smount of thermal\n\n: on.
